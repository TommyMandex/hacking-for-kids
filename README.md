# Cybersecurity For Kids

> **NOTE**: work in progress

This guide is meant to provide a roadmap for teaching kids getting first hands in cybersecurity. It is meant to show security from the perspective of the attacker and illustrate the various defense mechanisms.

## Topics

> **NOTE**: Some of these topcs require prerior knowledge to be successful at them. However, I don't believe it is a good approach to lecture kids on complex subject before they even get their hands on the stuff. The best way to learn is by practice so expect more hands-on exercises.

> **NOTE**: In no particular order here they are.

* Information Gathering
* Basic Security Mechanisms
  - Authentication - passwords
  - Authorization - who can do what and where
* Scripting
  - How to run commands
  - Basic scripting - pipes, etc
* Vulnerabilities
  - Making mistakes - what vuns are and why they exist
  - Exploits - what are exploits
* Hardware
  - Build simple evil USB

## Challenges

## Notes / Ideas

### Notes
* Setup a github project - might be too early
* How do you get a 3 year old started in security - good question
* Document everything in twitte account - this will be fun
* Record youtube videos

### Exercises

* Basic infra to show how to crack a password
* Simple binary reversing challange - change hex codes to bypass or display some funny message
